# Finger-Counter

A Finger Counter that counts the number of fingers that you are holding by detecting the landmarks of your fingertips and presents a picture of a hand similar to the number of finger that you are holding up, it uses the modules of MediaPipe.

# MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines. With MediaPipe, a perception pipeline can be built as a graph of modular components, including, for instance, inference models (e.g., TensorFlow, TFLite) and media processing functions.
